# Members

Includes a functor mappable sequence whose members are conformed by some pure operation (e.g. `distinct`).  This can be useful for operating against a collection of dom elements.  The nature of the elements can change as a result of these pure operations, thus the collection of elements might be mapped to select their text content.

Unusual?  This is precisely what jQuery does in certain instances.
