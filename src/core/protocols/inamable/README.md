# INamable

Represents something which can be named often for the purpose of allowing a human to differentiate between items in a broader collection.

* `name(self)` - Returns the name of the item.

It would be reasonable for names to appear as the text portion of entries in a dropdown, for example.

If the name is intended for machines prefer [`IIdentifiable`](./../iidentifiable).
