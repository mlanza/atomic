# Recon

Once the plan (`todo.md`) is structured, the agent conducts **recon**—a focused review of all materials the director provided, including the **PRD**, **AGENTS** doc, and any supporting sources. Recon is how the agent guards against overload and prepares each drive with clarity.

This is not a mechanical pass; it’s an **act of judgment**. The agent decides what truly matters for the work ahead—what guidance will help, what can wait, and what to ignore. Out of all inputs, the agent builds a *focused view* for each drive (see what that is [here](./quarterbacking.md)): a small, curated context package that travels with that section of the TODO.

For each drive, the agent:

* Reviews the full landscape of materials
* Selects the principles, examples, and ideas most relevant to that stretch of work
* Tacks on light **supports**—brief citations or reminders pointing back to source material
* Notes dependencies or constraints that emerge
* Keeps everything else parked in the PRD

The form of these supports is flexible—inline, callouts, tags—whatever keeps the plan clean and the agent’s head clear. The point is control: when running a play, the agent should see only what’s essential, not the noise of every possible input.

Recon keeps each chunk of the TODO both lean and informed—a bridge between abundant information and actionable focus.

Together with the **PRD** and **TODO**, the **Recon** helps go take a plan further, ensure a disciplined loop of attention.

The **PRD** defines the landscape, the **TODO** sequences it into lettered drives, and **Recon** equips each drive with the minimal context needed to advance one verified yard at a time.
