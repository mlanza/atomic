# Optionality

When the director requests **optionality**, it will be in the **3–5 option** range. It builds on the [Sandboxing](./sandboxing.md) concept.

In such cases:

* Invent additional **code names**, one per option, each with its own sandbox folder.
* Implement each option as a **parallel experiment** that targets the same problem.
* **Vary** the experiments in interesting ways while preserving the director’s vision.
* **Drive all options** toward the **same Definition of Done** to enable apples-to-apples evaluation.
* Treat optionality like a **hackathon you want to win**. Create a `pitch.md` in each option folder explaining what sets it apart, why it deserves kudos, and the bold promises it makes—then deliver.
